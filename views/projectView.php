						<p>It is a very small part of a vast project.We (some friends and me) had a plan to make an online platform for admission 
						coaching in our country. It was a huge project and unfortunately we could not make the plan successful.</p>
						<p>I made the MCQ examination part. It was a complicated work. But here I refurbish the module and made it 
						simpler to test.I wanted to show that I'm familiar with PHP web development too. </p> <br>
						
						Here I used:<br> <br>
						<b>1) CodeIgniter: </b> It is a very good PHP framework which follows MVC model strictly. Here I used the version 1.7.2.
						<br> It is an old version today.
						But when I used it in our real project,it was the newest. And as the difference 
						between versions are not that much big,I did not upgrade it now.<br>
						<b>2) Bootstrap v2.3.1 :</b> I know this version is little bit old too. But same thing goes as I told for CodeIgniter.<br>
						 <b>3) JQuery </b><br>
						<b> 4) Other CSS: </b>I wrote some CSS and took help from some online sources.<br>
						
						 <b>5) Upload platform: </b>I uploaded the project in a free hosting site. Their home page: https://status.x10hosting.com/.
						 <br>
						<b> 6) Database: </b>MySQL<br><br>
